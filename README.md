This project was created to complement my Minecraft server's auto-stopping abilities. Before this project, I had to tell server members to use port knocking to start the server. With this service, they can simply visit this web page and press the "Start Server" button!

This Docker service uses [Batchcraft](https://github.com/Kealper/Batchcraft) to communicate with the Minecraft server. See its license (Apache 2.0) for details.

See LICENSE.md for how this code is licensed.
